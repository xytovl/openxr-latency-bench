# OpenXR latency bench
Utility for measuring motion to photon latency using OpenXR

The tool displays a gray image which turns to colour when headset or controller movement is detected.
By taking a video with a high speed camera of the headset with the displays visible and taking the frame number when movement starts and when colour changes on display, it is possible to estimate the total latency.
